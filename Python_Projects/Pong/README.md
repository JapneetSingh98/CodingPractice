# This is my implementation of the classic game Pong.

This project requires you to have turtle installed.


## To play, run the pong.py file.

Player A can control their paddle with the 'W' and 'S' keys.
Player B can control their paddle with the 'P' and 'L' keys.

You can change various dimensions within the game by altering the constants.py file.
Ball speed is set by BALL_DX and BALL_DY
